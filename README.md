# OOP-school-library
Imagine that you are the librarian of OOP University, and you need a tool to record what books are in the library and who borrows them. This APP will allow you to:  Add new students or teachers. Add new books. Save records of who borrowed a given book and when. And all of this is done in a beautiful and well-organized way!
